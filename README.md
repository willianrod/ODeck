# For Users

ODeck is a free and open source alternative to StreamDeck made with React, React Native, Electron, Socket.IO and some other tecnologies. It allows you to easily control some features of your computer with the power of a tap on your smartphone.

It tends to be a cheaper alternative to StreamDeck because you can use your current smartphone or clean the dust from an older device from the bottom of your drawer and give another pourpose of life to this device.

#### Hotkey

With this action you will be able to invoke any hotkeys in your machine. It simulate the press of multiple keys in your machine, just like a normal keyboard but with just on touch of your finger.

By now you need to check this documentation here to see all available keys you can use (http://robotjs.io/docs/syntax#keyboard). The most common keys is listed bellow.

- shift
- control
- alt
- tab
- right_shift
- space
- Numbers and letters are represented by their own values. (a-z,0-9)

For example, if you want to simulate the press of this combination of keys (CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + 1) you will need to replace the key with their value shown on the documentation and separete them with a comma.

`control,shift,alt,1`
